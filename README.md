# Project Brief

The aim of the task is to code an interactive form where the user enters their credit card data to make a payment. (Replication of the design as accurately as possible).


To complete the task, I used the starter code available in the assets package. Utilize the SCSS preprocessor and "pure" JavaScript (Vanilla JS).

The final project should meet the following requirements:
---

* The form should be dynamically validated in an advanced form â€“ to proceed, all fields should be filled, and the credit card number should meet the requirements for credit card number validators

* The "Next step" button should only be active in the case of a properly validated form

* The form should be validated both after each character input and after clicking the button

* If the user clicks the active "Next step" button, a standard "Success" alert should appear

* The page should be correctly displayed on all types of devices (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)

* The page should have interactive elements properly handled, such as links and buttons (the user should feel that something is happening when hovering over an interactive element)
